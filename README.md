A summary of our work can be found in the [NeurIPS 2018 Poster](https://github.com/ievron/wltls/blob/master/Poster.pdf).

Some of our ideas and methods are based on [Log-time and Log-space Extreme Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/1611.01964) and its [code](https://github.com/kjasinska/ltls).

## Downloading the data

The multiclass datasets can be downloaded from [PD-Sparse](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~xrhuang/PDSparse/).

## Example 

Below is a command for training a W-LTLS model with a slice width of 5 on the `sector` dataset.
At the end of training, an experiment of sparse models is run.
Notice that a data directory in the following structure is required (as downloaded from [PD-Sparse](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~xrhuang/PDSparse/)):
```
$ ls /data/sector/
sector.heldout  sector.heldout_sorted  sector.test  sector.test_sorted  sector.train  sector.train_sorted
```

Also, a (possibly large) file named `/temp/model.npz` is created during training.

```
$ python3 wltls.py sector /data /temp/ -slice_width 5 -rnd_seed 1337 --sparse
